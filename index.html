<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hi, my name is Thao and I am an Australian born Vietnamese. I was born on the 3rd of September, 2002, in Melbourne. I attended high school at Koonung Secondary College located in Mont Albert North and am currently in the process of completing my Bachelor of Information Technology at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. My hobbies include drawing, badminton, reading, binge watching anime and you can often find me spending my Centrelink funds on food along Swanston Street.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have little experience with IT, other than the typical functionings of Microsoft programs, therefore I was interested in this course to challenge myself and learn more regarding different aspects of Information Technology. I also decided to pursue the information technology field as it plays such a fundamental role to today’s society. I am especially interested in the User Centred Design aspect of Information Technology, as I enjoy learning about how society utilises aspects of IT, to communicate ideas and make websites that appeal to audiences.</span></p>

I may also be too idealistic and not think logically, as I prioritise my feelings over logic. I am also sensitive to my surroundings and highly appreciate art and creativity. </span></p>
